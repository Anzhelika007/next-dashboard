## Overview

This project is designed to help you get hands-on experience with building a dashboard application using Next.js. Throughout the course, you will learn how to:

- Set up a Next.js project from scratch.
- Create dynamic routes and API endpoints.
- Fetch and display data from external APIs.
- Manage application state and pass data between components.
- Implement basic UI components and styling.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/nextjs-dashboard-app.git
   cd nextjs-dashboard-app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**  
   `npm install`

3. **Run the development server:**  
   `npm run dev`
